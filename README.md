# GTF - Get The Flag :checkered_flag: :hourglass_flowing_sand:



These scripts include basic ciphers coded in python and have some errors in them which you will need to debug.

### Flow: 

Debug the following:
- script1.py 
- script2.py
- script3.py

After you have debugged and got output for the first 3 scripts, you will have to combine all three together to get a single value which will be passed as an input to the final script.

Get outputs for all three and combine them as: 
> output_script1 + output_script2 + output_script3

Supply this combined output into script4.py.

After getting the output you will get a link (only if your output is correct) where you will have to find the flag.


## How will you get to know what the flag is?



You will have to throroughly search for the flag. It will be in a form: 

> ***gtf = xxxxxx......***

*where xxx... will be the flag.*



Once found, you have to show us the flag.


The team who solves and gets the flag fastest, wins!



**All the best. May the force be with you!** :purple_heart:
