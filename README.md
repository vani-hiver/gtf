# GTF - Get The Flag :checkered_flag: :hourglass_flowing_sand:



These scripts include basic ciphers coded in python. The first three scripts have some errors in them which you will need to debug.

After you have debugged and got output for the first 3 scripts, you will have to combine all three together to get a single value which will be passed as an input to the final script.

After getting the output you will get a link (only if your output is correct) where you will have to find the flag.



## How will you get to know what the flag is?



You will have to throroughly search for the flag. It will be in a form: 

> ***gtf = xxxxxx......***

*where xxx... will be the flag.*



Once found, you have to show us the flag.


The team who solves and gets the flag fastest, wins!



**All the best. May the force be with you!** :purple_heart:
